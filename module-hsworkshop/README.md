# HS Workshop — AI Stack

OpenWebUI + Langfuse v3 + TrustyAI guardrails running in the `hsworkshop` namespace on OpenShift, backed by a vLLM InferenceService.

## Architecture

```
User → OpenWebUI → guardrails-proxy → TrustyAI gateway → KServe InferenceService (vLLM)
                        ↓                    ↓
                  /v1/models          built-in regex detector
                  (direct to          (Czech + English swear words)
                   predictor)           ↓ blocked → tag trace in Langfuse
           ↓
       Pipelines (filter)
           ↓
       Langfuse (tracing)
           ↳ Web API → MinIO → Worker → ClickHouse
                                              ↓
                                    HSWorkshop Insights
                                    (word cloud · word graph · AI summary)

       SearXNG (self-hosted web search, used by Career Guide preset)
```

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| OpenWebUI | Chat UI with OpenAI-compatible backend |

## Routes

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| OpenWebUI | https://openwebui-hsworkshop.apps.brno-hack-pool-s5z4r.aws.rh-ods.com |
| Langfuse | https://langfuse-hsworkshop.apps.brno-hack-pool-s5z4r.aws.rh-ods.com |
| HSWorkshop Insights | https://insights-hsworkshop.apps.brno-hack-pool-s5z4r.aws.rh-ods.com |

## Initial Setup

### 1. Apply secrets (first time only)

```bash
cd module-hsworkshop
./apply-secrets.sh
```

This generates random credentials, prints them for your password manager, then applies them as OpenShift secrets. The script is idempotent-safe via `--dry-run=client` for the namespace but will fail if secrets already exist — delete them first if re-running.

Secrets created: `postgres-secret`, `clickhouse-secret`, `langfuse-secret`, `minio-secret`, `openwebui-secret`, `insights-db-secret`.

> **Note:** `guardrails-langfuse-secret` is NOT created by this script — it requires Langfuse API keys that only exist after Langfuse is running (step 5). See the Langfuse section below for the command.

### 2. Deploy via ArgoCD

Apply the ArgoCD application:

```bash
oc apply -f hsworkshop-argocd-app.yaml
```

Then sync in the ArgoCD UI or:

```bash
oc annotate application.argoproj.io hsworkshop -n openshift-gitops \
  argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
```

### 3. Log in to OpenWebUI

The admin account is created automatically on first boot using `WEBUI_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `WEBUI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `openwebui-secret` (set by `apply-secrets.sh`).

1. Open https://openwebui-hsworkshop.apps.brno-hack-pool-s5z4r.aws.rh-ods.com
2. Log in with the email and password you saved in your password manager

Subsequent users can self-register and get immediate access — `DEFAULT_USER_ROLE=user` and `ENABLE_SIGNUP=true` are set in `openwebui.yaml`.

> **Note:** If updating an existing install, the signup setting may already be stored in the database. Enable it manually if needed: Admin Panel → Settings → General → Enable New User Sign Up → on.

### 4. Update OpenWebUI API connection (mandatory)

OpenWebUI stores the model API URL in its database, which overrides the env var after first boot. Update it to route through the guardrails proxy:

1. Admin Panel → Settings → Connections → OpenAI API
2. Set URL to: `http://guardrails-proxy.hsworkshop.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1`
3. Verify the connection shows green

### 5. Set up Langfuse

#### 5a. Create Langfuse admin account

1. Open https://langfuse-hsworkshop.apps.brno-hack-pool-s5z4r.aws.rh-ods.com
2. Click **Sign up** and create an admin account
3. Create an **Organization** and a **Project** (e.g. `hsworkshop`)

#### 5b. Generate API keys

1. In your project go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Click **Create new API key**
3. Copy the **Public Key** (`pk-lf-...`) and **Secret Key** (`sk-lf-...`) — the secret is only shown once

#### 5c. Connect OpenWebUI to Pipelines

Langfuse tracing in OpenWebUI works via the **Pipelines** service (a filter layer). The `pipelines` pod is deployed alongside the stack.

In OpenWebUI Admin Panel:
1. Go to **Settings → Connections**
2. Add a new OpenAI API connection:
   - **URL**: `http://pipelines:9099`
   - **API Key**: `0p3n-w3bu!`
3. Save

#### 5d. Install the Langfuse filter pipeline

1. Go to **Admin Panel → Settings → Pipelines**
2. Click **Install from GitHub URL** and enter:
   ```
   https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/blob/main/examples/filters/langfuse_v3_filter_pipeline.py
   ```
3. Once installed, open the pipeline settings and enter your Langfuse keys:
   - **Langfuse Public Key**: `pk-lf-...`
   - **Langfuse Secret Key**: `sk-lf-...`
   - **Langfuse Host**: `http://langfuse:3000`
4. Save — conversations will now appear as traces in Langfuse

#### 5e. Connect guardrails proxy to Langfuse (blocked content tagging)

The guardrails proxy tags blocked requests in Langfuse with `tags: ["blocked"]` so the Insights app can show a "Blocked only" word cloud/graph. It needs its own API key (separate from the Pipelines filter).

1. In Langfuse UI go to **Settings → API Keys → Create new key** and copy the keys
2. Apply the secret to the cluster:
   ```bash
   oc create secret generic guardrails-langfuse-secret -n hsworkshop \
     --from-literal=LANGFUSE_HOST=http://langfuse:3000 \
     --from-literal=LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-... \
     --from-literal=LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-... \
     --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc apply -f -
   ```
3. Restart the proxy to pick up the secret:
   ```bash
   oc rollout restart deployment/guardrails-proxy -n hsworkshop
   ```

> **Switching projects:** When moving to a new workshop run (e.g. `run-1`, `run-2`), create a new API key in that project's Langfuse settings and repeat steps 2–3 above. The Insights app picks up the new project automatically from the dropdown — no restart needed.

### 6. Import model presets

The `configuration-models.json` file defines the two workshop presets (**Career Guide** and **Free Chat**). Import them:

1. Admin Panel → Workspace → Models → Import (upload icon)
2. Select `module-hsworkshop/configuration-models.json`
3. For each imported model, open it and set **Visibility** to **Public** — imported models default to Private and won't appear in the model selector for regular users

To hide the raw base model from the model selector so users only see the presets:

- Admin Panel → Workspace → Models → toggle off `eurollm-22b-service`

## Configuration files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `configuration-models.json` | OpenWebUI model presets (Career Guide, Free Chat) — import via Admin Panel |

## Verifying the stack

```bash
# All pods should be Running
oc get pods -n hsworkshop

# Model should be READY=True
oc get inferenceservice -n hsworkshop

# Quick model health check via guardrails proxy
oc run curl-test --rm -i --restart=Never --image=curlimages/curl -n hsworkshop -- \
  curl -s http://guardrails-proxy.hsworkshop.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1/models
```

## Updating the model

Chat completions flow through `guardrails-proxy` → TrustyAI gateway → predictor. Model listing goes direct from the proxy to the predictor. When switching models, update three places:

1. **`install/openwebui.yaml`** — `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` stays pointing at the guardrails proxy (no change needed unless proxy moves)
2. **`install/profanity-detector.yaml`** — update `PREDICTOR` variable to the new predictor hostname
3. **`install/guardrails.yaml`** — update `autoConfig.inferenceServiceToGuardrail` to the new InferenceService name
4. **`hsworkshop-argocd-app.yaml`** — update the model values file reference
5. **`configuration-models.json`** — update `base_model_id` in both presets to match the new model ID

After deploying, update the OpenWebUI API connection URL (step 4 above) if the predictor hostname changed.

## Resetting conversation data

To wipe all traces between workshop runs (keeps schema, secrets, and MinIO blobs intact):

```bash
CH_USER=$(oc get secret clickhouse-secret -n hsworkshop -o jsonpath='{.data.CLICKHOUSE_USER}' | base64 -d)
CH_PASS=$(oc get secret clickhouse-secret -n hsworkshop -o jsonpath='{.data.CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d)
PROJECT_ID="<your-langfuse-project-id>"  # visible in Langfuse URL or traces query below

# Find the project ID
oc exec -n hsworkshop deployment/clickhouse -- \
  clickhouse-client --user "$CH_USER" --password "$CH_PASS" \
  --query "SELECT project_id, count() FROM default.traces GROUP BY project_id"

# Delete trace data (analytics_* are Views — no need to touch them)
for table in traces observations scores; do
  oc exec -n hsworkshop deployment/clickhouse -- \
    clickhouse-client --user "$CH_USER" --password "$CH_PASS" \
    --query "ALTER TABLE default.${table} DELETE WHERE project_id = '${PROJECT_ID}'"
done
```

> **Note:** `analytics_traces`, `analytics_observations`, and `analytics_scores` are ClickHouse Views derived from the base tables — deleting from the base tables is sufficient and attempts to mutate Views will fail with `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

## Troubleshooting

**OpenWebUI shows no models** — the InferenceService is not Ready. Check:
```bash
oc get inferenceservice -n hsworkshop
oc get pods -n hsworkshop -l serving.kserve.io/inferenceservice=eurollm-22b-service
oc logs -n hsworkshop -l serving.kserve.io/inferenceservice=eurollm-22b-service -c kserve-container
```

**Chat responses are empty or stuck** — the guardrails proxy may be unhealthy. Check:
```bash
oc get pods -n hsworkshop -l app=guardrails-proxy
oc logs -n hsworkshop deployment/guardrails-proxy
```
Also verify OpenWebUI's API connection URL is pointing at `http://guardrails-proxy.hsworkshop.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1` (Admin Panel → Settings → Connections).

**Langfuse traces not appearing** — tracing goes through the Pipelines service. Check:
- Pipelines pod is Running: `oc get pods -n hsworkshop -l app=pipelines`
- OpenWebUI is connected to Pipelines: Admin Panel → Settings → Connections → `http://pipelines:9099`
- Langfuse filter pipeline is installed and configured with correct host/keys: Admin Panel → Settings → Pipelines

**Langfuse worker crashing** — check logs and MinIO connectivity:
```bash
oc logs -n hsworkshop deployment/langfuse-worker --tail=30
oc get pods -n hsworkshop -l app=minio
```

**ArgoCD sync stuck** — if sync hangs waiting for InferenceService health, force a new operation:
```bash
oc patch application.argoproj.io hsworkshop -n openshift-gitops \
  --type=json -p='[{"op":"remove","path":"/operation"}]'
```
Then do a hard refresh and trigger a fresh sync from the UI:
```bash
oc annotate application.argoproj.io hsworkshop -n openshift-gitops \
  argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
```

**Model pod stuck Pending after rolling update** — KServe rolling updates can deadlock when only one GPU is available: the new pod can't schedule until the old one is gone, but the old one won't terminate until the new one is ready. Fix by deleting the old pod manually:
```bash
oc get pods -n hsworkshop -l serving.kserve.io/inferenceservice=eurollm-22b-service
oc delete pod -n hsworkshop <old-predictor-pod-name>
```

**TrustyAI AutoConfigFailed** — the operator locks into a failed state via an annotation. Fix by deleting and recreating the resource to force a fresh reconcile:
```bash
oc delete guardrailsorchestrator guardrails-orchestrator -n hsworkshop
oc apply -f module-hsworkshop/install/guardrails.yaml
```

**TrustyAI orchestrator broken after operator reconcile** — the operator regenerates its ConfigMaps on reconcile, reverting two manual patches. Re-apply after any reconcile:

```bash
# Fix 1: backend port (headless service requires pod port 8080, not service port 80)
oc patch configmap guardrails-orchestrator-auto-config -n hsworkshop --type merge -p '{
  "data": {
    "config.yaml": "openai:\n  service:\n    hostname: eurollm-22b-service-predictor.hsworkshop.svc.cluster.local\n    port: 8080\ndetectors:\n  built-in-detector:\n    type: text_contents\n    service:\n      hostname: 127.0.0.1\n      port: 8080\n    chunker_id: whole_doc_chunker\n    default_threshold: 0.5\npassthrough_headers:\n  - Authorization\n  - Content-Type\n"
  }
}'

# Fix 2: swear word regex (replace $^ placeholder with actual pattern)
# Run the patch script — see module-hsworkshop/apply-trustyai-patches.sh
```

> The swear word regex patch is too long for inline kubectl. Use `apply-trustyai-patches.sh` after any reconcile (see below).

**TrustyAI reconcile is triggered** when: the `GuardrailsOrchestrator` CR changes, or a Service with label `trustyai/guardrails-groupA` appears/disappears. After re-applying patches, restart the orchestrator:
```bash
oc rollout restart deployment/guardrails-orchestrator -n hsworkshop
```
